But once we build roads and railways as the infrastructure for a certain generation, data centers are the critical infrastructure for building the digital economy. And so lack of electricity in America and in a number of Western countries is a problem. And in contrast, I see China building power plants left and right, right, including nuclear. So that would be an interesting dynamic. And then semiconductors is another bottleneck. But AI is so complicated. I think we also need more data, we also need more better algorithms.

So get us any amount of compute, we will use it all up and say we still don't have enough. So this is a constraint for the last 20 years or so. But what I'M seeing is with the rise of Genai, there are very valuable workloads. For example, AI assisted coding is fantastic. It's making us so much more productive. But if you use cloud code enough, sometimes you get very limited. And I find that many companies really have excess demand, which is a very rare problem to have. But so many people want more om inference, want more tokens generated and we just don't have the semiconductors and the data centers and electricity to meet the demand. But there's a lot we could do with AI token generation and it's frustrating when on the supply side we can't supply enough to people that want it. On the demand side, you get very limited if you use too much.",

      "en": "So it is true that token generation is getting more efficient and cheaper. In fact, if you look at OpenAI's open weight model, they actually release models that are very efficient to run. So I think they did a good job with. Was it like 120, 120 billion parameters or something with I think 5.7 billion active. So it's a very efficient model to run. But despite the cost of token generation falling, our demand for it is insatiable. One interesting thing that's happened in AI is if we look at where the buckets of value. One of the big buckets of value is AI assisted coding. And I think this harkens back to an earlier era. In a previous generation, I think Google came to dominate horizontal information discovery like web search. But there's room for lots of verticals when the Internet was being built. So we wound up with Travelocity and Expedia Forte for travel. Bunch of folks fought out in retail, a bunch of others fought out in transportation, social media and so on. What we're seeing now is ChatGPT has such a strong consumer brand. ChatGPT seems to be the dominant player in the new gen horizontal information discovery, or I think Gemini with its channel advantage through control of Android and Chrome is a serious player as well. But if that's where horizontal information turns out to be, then there's still plenty of room for lots of verticals to be built out of the clear buckets of really valuable verticals. Is AI coding assistance where cloud code is? You know, I use that every day. Love it. OpenAI codecs has a lot of momentum as well, but it's clearly making developers so much more productive and efficient that the demand is just through the roof for let's use more and more of this. One thing I find exciting is I often look at AI coding assistance as a harbinger for what might happen to other job functions as well as as the AI marketing tools become more efficient, as the AI recruiting tools become more efficient, AI finance tools become more efficient. So I often look at AI coding assistance as maybe a foreshadowing what may happen as well to other sectors as the tools get better for them too.",

      "en": "Over the last few years the US Federal government has done some good things and some less helpful things. I feel like clearing out unnecessary regulations has been a very good move. Even last year, the bipartisan Schumer AI Insight Forum, I think there are a lot of people lobbying the US Government to pass siphoning regulations. There are a lot of hyped up AI safety narrative saying AI could lead to human extinction, which I think is kind of a ridiculous statement to try to get stifling anti competitive Regulations passed often to try to shut down open source open weight. Fortunately, we've beat back a lot of that. But I think the bipartisan Schumer Insight Forum did a really good job digging the truth and concluding that America should be investing in AI rather than passing unnecessary regulations to slow it down. I think Trump did a good job and then his whole team, David Sacks and Christian and so on, did a good job clearing out unnecessary regulations. On the flip side, one of America's huge competitive advantages has been this ability to attract talent, including high skill talent as well as frankly, young talent that may not currently be high skill, but could be high skill in the future. And so I think to the extent that America is not investing as much in attracting talent, I think that would be an unforced error. And then I think lastly investments in science. I think helping our institutions of higher education have the resources to train our grad students to invest in science and technology, I think that's really precious.

So let me tell you what I'm seeing in software engineering, the most productive engineers I know, they're not fresh college grads. They are people of 10, 20 years of experience or whatever and really on top of AI and know the AI tools and understand AI. So those people experienced and on top of AI move faster than anything the world has seen even one or two years ago. One tier down is actually a fresh Carlos Grant that are really on top of AI. So I've hired quite a few people, fresh college grads that for whatever reason, through the social network community, really learn the AI tools and they move really fast, but they're not as good as people experience that. No AI. One tier down from the fresh college grads is the people with 10 years of coding experience but who had A comfortable job and for whatever reason is still coding like it's 2022 before ChatGPT. Those people, I just don't hire people like that anymore. But there are people that did a comfortable job, they kept coding the old way and they just did not learn AI. I think those people may get into trouble at some point. But there's one other one which is the tier that is in trouble, which is the fresh car Strats that don't know AI. One unfortunate thing is university curricula is slow to change. And so I actually feel pretty bad that even today there are universities graduating CS undergrads that have not made a single call to a single API on the Internet. Imagine graduating a CS undergrad that has never heard of cloud computing. It's like, what is the cloud? Oh, I don't need to just run things. That's weird. You just can't be a CS major and not know how to do things in the cloud. And I feel like I'm getting to the point where I don't think it's right. I feel like we've got to not train CS majors without also making sure they know how to use AI to help them with coding, without also making them know the AI building blocks but university curriculum. And that's the cohort of students that entering the job market that's really struggling. But the fresh college grads know AI. We can't find enough of them.

The way that the U.S. and I think the way the U.S. first put restrictions on Huawei and then later on export of Nvidia and AMD and other semiconductors that really incentivized China. So before the export controls, semiconductor development in China frankly wasn't moving that fast. It was a nice area, there was some investment, but when America did that, then China really accelerated is semiconductor development. And so America incentivized China to do this. And it is paying off for China. I think a number of Chinese companies are building offerings that individual chips are less powerful, but maybe a much larger number of chips trying to build offerings competitive with certainly the last generation of Nvidia, maybe increasingly the current generation. So I think if I were to analyze just purely US national self interest, I think that caused China to accelerate a semiconductor industry in a way that may not be helpful to the US long term.",

Are we getting to the point where people are using such esoteric financial instruments to find cash flow that there'll be a bubble? We could debate that we definitely need a lot of investments. But when does it become over investment? That's an interesting question. The other place that I think we need to invest in a lot is not just the infra data center foundation model layer, but the application layer. Because of others having spent billions of dollars to train these AI models, we can now access them for hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars or whatever, or tens of dollars. So it's wonderful to build tons of applications that just were not possible before now. From a VC investment perspective I've heard from multiple VCs is bizarrely the cost of trying something is so low that that there are fewer ideas. It's not quite sure where to put massive amounts of capital to work at the application layer. In fact, if you look at a lot of the application layer investments, sometimes it feels like, you know, firms are putting in $100 million so that they can pay open and anthropic, so the open anthropic can pay Nvidia, which is where all the money is ending up. Having said that, there's so many valuable bets to be placed at the application layer to just build stuff. But the dilemma is you could do it in a very capital efficient way. So if someone wants to say I want to put $10 billion to work, yes, you can build $10 billion worth of data centers. We know how to spend that money. But how do you spend $10 billion in building applications? The problem is almost it only cost me a million dollars to try an idea. So how do I spend $10 billion?

Unfortunately, we turned out to be right. But so last year, I think it was around August, we started exploring building technology to help with tariff compliance. And by the way, I don't know if you've seen these tariff compliance docs, but frankly, when I look at what it takes to fill this paperwork, it makes me wonder, oh my God, what is this? So you say import a bicycle, then you look at the specs of the bicycle, how much does it cost, the size of the wheels? There are all these rules and regulations to import a bicycle. It just, it just makes me go, oh my God, are humans really doing this? So we built agentic workflows to read the tariff compliance documents carefully, get the spec for what someone wants to import carefully, try to match, make suggestions. And so this is now one of our portfolio companies called Gaia, Gaia Dynamics, that because of the increased complexity in tariff compliance, has been doing pretty well. Right. I find that we just could not have done this without agentic workflows. We have medical assistants, we have different startups, Airflow for fellow companies, medical assistant operating in India, AI assistant, Callidus helping process legal documents. Many of these workloads we just could not do. So I find that they're useful AI agentic workflows already today and the large businesses too, not just our startups, but when we look at the hyperscalers and I chat to friends and some of the large businesses, there's a bunch of internal workflows that we just could not be doing without these AI agents.",

So one obvious one ohm token prices have been rapidly falling, right? Depending on who you believe, following Aperson, urine or whatever. Kind of. Frankly, when we build prototypes, we routinely just not worry about token costs because the first most important thing is let's build a product that users love. And then what we find is after we build something, this actually happened to me a few times now, we'll build something and not worry about the cost, and then users start to use it, and then our API bill starts climbing. And then it is really like kind of you looking at this every few weeks and go, whoa, this is getting really expensive. This costing. Costing me. Salary of one engineer. Costing me more than two engineers. Cost me more than a whole bunch of engineers. All right. But fortunately, when that has happened almost every time so far, we've been able to use techniques to bend the cost curve back down even faster than the rate at which token prices are falling in the market.

Actually let me give one example, then I'll come back to data. There's been this buzz about oh, with AI we'll have unicorns with one employee, right? It's like a thing and it's fine. If you want to build a unicorn startup billion dollar with one employee, go for it. It's a good thing to do. But frankly, if you're doing a billion dollar valuation, you could afford to pay two employees or even 10. So why do you need to hype it all the way up to say let's do this with just one employee? It is true that team sizes are shrinking. We get more done with smaller teams. So that is true. But the hype is then saying let's build a unicorn with one size. I find a lot of AI hype is so hard to disentangle because there's a gem of truth in it. It's just been hyped up a lot more. So on data. Data is important, but it turns out that data is very verticalized and you don't need as much of it to get started. As you want, as you think. So for example, landing AI does a lot of work with financial institutions, healthcare, a lot of financial institutions have plenty of transaction data. Take the PDF file, turn it into earned ready markdown text, go process that, find value in that. For example, I don't know, we could take SEC filings, large complex financial tables very accurately turn those financial tables into Excel spreadsheets, then go get your analysts or your AI to analyze that and draw conclusions. So you could do that so often with bit of scrappiness, looking at internal data, look at public data, you can often get some stuff going. And it turns out that a lot of Internet data is kind of general purpose data. Most of the world's data is actually private and so a lot of businesses actually very valuable transaction data, sales data, product data, manufacturing data, logistics data and all that data with a scrappy team that knows how to use it can actually start to build something, get value out of it.

And I'm already seeing, I mentioned the mark of the example just now with building an app for feedback swiping. But I think for a lot of job functions, people that know how to tell a computer exactly what they wanted to do so the computer can do it for you, they'll just be more powerful. And for the foreseeable future, the language of precisely telling computers what you wanted to do is coding. It doesn't mean you should write code by hand. Writing code by hand is becoming obsolete, right? Really don't do that, but get AI to write code for you and people can do that. Would be more effective and more powerful and have more fun.",

      "zh": "所以在我看来，问题是AI主要是为了省成本还是为了促进增长？我知道改变工作流程不容易，很多公司往往先想到省成本。但也许问题在这。我发现一个模式，比如说我有一个工作流程有五个步骤，每个步骤占我20%的精力。假设我在审批贷款，决定批不批这笔贷款。为了简单起见，假设有五个步骤，每个占20%的精力。如果你能自动化其中一个步骤，那就是20%的成本节约，挺不错的，尤其是对利润低的生意。但这不算是个游戏规则改变者。我发现更有价值的AI应用其实需要重新思考流程。我看到的模式是，不只是节省20%的成本，而是要么做得更多，要么做得更快。比如在贷款审批中，如果不是节省20%的人力，而是重新设计流程，把决策时间缩短。比如不再需要等两周让贷款专员看，而是能在10分钟内给你初步答案，这就改变了产品，推动了增长。这是个更快的模式。还有一个是做得更多。比如有些生意原本只能为高端客户提供高接触服务，但如果你能服务更多人，或者说在金融建议方面，不再只给少数人高质量服务，而是能为更多人提供同样的服务品质，这又改变了产品，推动了增长。所以，与其说是省成本，如果AI能让你做得更快或者让一个任务翻倍地做，比如不再只服务少数人，而是能经济地服务更多人，这就是我看到的两个推动价值增长的模式。我认为这对于释放更大的增长潜力很重要。",
      "en": "So to me the question is, is AI mostly for cost savings or is it for growth? And I know that it's difficult to change workflows. A lot of companies tend to think cost savings. But maybe here's the problem. There's actually one pattern I see. Let's say I have a work toss that has five steps and let's say each step takes 20% of my effort. Maybe I'm underwriting approvals, do I approve this loan or not? So let's say for simplicity, there are five steps, each takes 20% of my EFF. If you can automate one of those steps, it's a 20% cost savings, which is really nice. It could be great if you're a low margin business, but it doesn't feel like a game changer. So what I find is that the more valuable uses of AI it actually requires, it often requires rethinking that workflow. And the pattern I see is instead of taking the 20% cost savings which you could do, that's fine, nothing wrong with that. The two patterns to this then getting growth is either do more or do it faster. So in the case of underwriting, making loans, if instead of saving 20% of my human labor, if I can now rework the workflow to turn around my decision making time. So instead of someone needing to wait two weeks before loan officer looks at it, but we can just give you an initial answer in 10 minutes that changes the product and lets you drive growth. So that's a faster pattern. And then there's also the more pattern. So another example, there are a lot of, I don't know, businesses that could do high touch, you know, say customer service only for expensive high end clients. Right? But if you can now serve a much larger group of people, or let's say financial advice instead of giving high touch financial advice to a small group of people, if you can now deliver that quality of service along more people, then that again changes the product and lets you drive growth. So instead of cost savings, if AI lets you do something way faster or lets you take a task and do it a thousand times more, instead of serving a small number of people, let's serve a lot more people because it's not economic to do so. These are the two patterns I've seen to drive value increases. And I think that would be important for unlocking lawless GP growth.",

      "en": "I think this will evolve over time. I'm going to make an analogy. In the early days of say, the computing industry, it was the vertical players that won. Because if you want to connect the keyboard to your computer motherboard, which is a CPU, is it okay if your keyboard has a plus minus 5 volts and your CPU has some other voltage, is that okay or not? So we didn't know where the API boundaries or if your CPU has memory laid out a certain way, a compute and your math accelerator, they needed to interoperate with each other. So before we wound up having a clear conception of where they draw lines and whether the API boundaries the integrated players, IBM back in the day could solve all the problems and build valuable working products. But as the industry matured, we started to have standards. For example, now with a USB stick standard, before there were other standards. So now you make a computer, someone else makes a keyboard, we plug them together and it all works. So when an industry is immature, it turns out where to draw those boundaries, to let different participants do their part and have it still interoperate. That's less clear. But then as the industry matures and there's more standards for if I want to publish a compressed OM model on the Internet, what's the function, our format for that, it's time to see more standards, then that makes it easier for individual players to do something and still have it fit into the broader ecosystem.",

I'm sometimes on customer calls myself. And then we bring in founders to work alongside us. We're reviewing the product, giving feedback on the product, arguing about pricing.
