      "zh": "这真是个有趣的转变，尤其是在过去一年左右。当我加入微软时，正好是 OpenAI 和大型基础模型兴起的时候，紧接着就出现了一波专有和开放前沿的模型，推动了前沿的发展。这些模型变得更高效，然后我们开始看到它们在各个领域的专业化。最近，这些模型甚至可以进行工具调用、功能调用，还能采取行动。我觉得这让新型产品有了成功的机会。\n\n突然之间，产品不再只是我们发布的静态物品了。不是简单地想出个点子，解决个问题，发布出去，稍微改进一下，然后搞个仪表盘。现在，整个关键指标变成了产品团队的\"新陈代谢\"能力，能否吸收数据，消化奖励模型，并创造出一些结果。因为这些模型现在非常有效，你希望能针对某些结果进行调优，比如价格、性能或质量。\n\n这挺让人兴奋的，因为这些产品就像活的有机体，随着更多的互动而变得更好。在很多方面，我觉得这就是每个公司新的知识产权，这是一种完全不同的产品构建方式，甚至让我们重新思考那些会思考、会成长的产品，真是挺激动人心的。",
      "en": "It's a. It's been a pretty interesting shift, especially over the last year or so, because when I got to Microsoft it was kind of right after OpenAI and the large foundation models happen and then immediately after there was this explosion of models Proprietary open frontier models that were pushing the frontier curve. And so they were both more efficient. And then we started to see domain level expertise and a bunch of them. And then, you know, even more recently, models now can, you know, tool call and they can function call and they can take action. And I think that's just giving way to a new type of products that are starting to see some success. And so all of a sudden products aren't just like these static artifacts that we start to ship. It's not just like, hey, come up with an idea or an insight, go solve a problem, ship it into the world, maybe make it a little bit better, and then have a dashboard. All of a sudden the, the whole KPI is what is the, the metabolism of a product team to be able to ingest data and then digest the rewards model and then create some sort of outcome. Because these models are so effective at this point, you want to start to tune them to certain types of outcomes, whether it's price or performance or quality. And so it's pretty exciting because all of a sudden these are these living organisms that just get better with the more interactions that happen. And in many ways I think this is the new IP of every single company and it's a completely different way to build product and to even think about, you know, products that think and live and learn, which is kind of exciting.",

      "en": "So when I hear this, what I'm thinking about is when I had Michael Turrell on the podcast the Cursor CEO, he talked a lot about how their big mode is the data that they capture from people using cursor, selecting, accepting certain suggestions, not accepting other suggestions.

      "zh": "我觉得后训练之所以兴起，是因为这些模型本身实在太强大了。今年，Nathan Lambert 做了一项研究，他发现一旦模型参数达到300亿，继续投入大量资金和算力去训练和预运行，就不太划算了，反而可以在循环中进行优化。所以，我觉得用自己的数据来优化是最好的方法。当然，你也可以合成数据，但需要设计奖励机制，推出并认真做AB测试，找到最适合的场景。这样就能产生数据供你学习。我还没见过哪种产品只靠一个循环来运作的，通常都是多条线并行，就像组装线一样，持续输出。",
      "en": "I think why we're seeing like the rise of post training happen is just that the, the models themselves like are so powerful. As of this year, Nathan Lambert did this study that I thought was pretty interesting of all the top leaderboards and it showed that, you know, once a model hits 30 billion parameters, the capex to actually train a model and put, you know, billions of tokens into kind of pre run kind of doesn't economically make sense and you can kind of start to optimize on the loop. And so yeah, in many ways I think you can, I think using your own data is the best way to do that. But you can synthetically generate data. You have to come up with a rewards design, you have to actually roll it out, you have to ab test it rigorously you have to find the job to be done or the use case that it makes the most sense for. And then, yes, like that generates data that you can learn from. I haven't ever seen it be one loop for any sort of product. I think it's multiple tracks running in parallel that are kind of like assembly lines, if you will, and kind of producing that.",

      "en": "This reminds me why I just had Nick Turley on the podcast who we were talking about before we started recording head of ChatGPT. And I was asking just like, how much has ChatGPT changed with GPT5 coming out? And he's just like, it's the same thing, they're the same product. It's just like the model tells us what to do in the product of ChatGPT. And it makes me think about something else of just like you would think, why can't just GPT5 build its own user interface? Just like as you use it, it just evolved. It's sort of what it's doing with Canvas and all these things.

      "zh": "嗯，所以我觉得有些东西更多是适用于整个组织本身，还有一些是适用于那些在构建AI产品的人。总体来说，我看到成功公司的一个模式正在显现。首先，他们拥抱AI，让所有人都能熟练使用AI。我觉得大家都在日常工作中使用一些助手或AI工具，所以没人害怕AI，反而知道它能提升技能和任务的上限，同时降低难度。\n\n第二步，他们开始思考，如何将AI应用到现有流程中，让它变得更好。比如客户支持，或者将欺诈处理时间从15天缩短到10天。这个过程就是梳理流程、应用AI、观察影响，然后感受到利润和内在的好处。\n\n第三步就是，好的，现在你看到影响了，大家都在用了，怎么用它推动增长呢？比如提升客户体验，提高客户生命周期价值或留存率。也可能是共同创造新的概念或类别，或者从嵌入式agent到具身agent，能够承担更多任务。\n\n我觉得公司失败的地方在于，他们为了AI而做AI，同时启动很多项目，却没有一个蓝图去理解它是如何运作的，也没有把它当作真正的投资来对待，所以没有设置好测量、观察和评估的机制。企业面临的困难在于技术不断变化。去年有7万个企业级AI工具上线，很难知道该用哪个工具达到什么效果。所以你需要押注一个平台或应用服务器类的层，方便你替换工具，而不是依赖某一项技术或工具。因为整个行业会变，你得为未来变化做好准备，而不是停留在现状。\n\n在企业层面，我看到的就是这样。我觉得那些开发者本身也在发生根本性的变化。每次技术进步都会带来一系列角色的变化，比如从大型机到个人电脑、从服务器到云和移动，出现了SEO专家、CDN、增长黑客、用户体验研究等等。现在我们看到的是多才多艺的开发者崛起，全栈开发者迎来了复兴。一个普通组织可能需要10个步骤才能推出一个产品，可能需要安全审查、规格制定、用户研究等等，涉及五六个功能部门，有六七个层级。突然之间，有500个不同的接触点要去协调才能推出一个产品。而每周有500个新模型或技术出现，这显然不够。因此，我非常相信全栈开发者的概念。你可以在一些新兴的AI公司看到这种趋势，甚至一些有50年历史的企业也开始这样运作。我认为这能带来速度和效率，让你更快地吸收和处理信息。",
      "en": "Yeah. So I think there's things that are kind of more broadly applying to the organization themselves and then there's things that are applying to the people who are building the, the AI products too. So more broadly I think there's, there's a pattern that's starting to emerge for successful companies. Like one is they are embracing AI and everybody becomes AI fluent. So I think everybody's using some sort of co pilot or some sort of AI in their day to day workflows like job one. So everyone's not afraid of it, understands how it can raise the ceiling and, and kind of lower, lower the floor for like all sorts of skills and tasks. Number two, from there they start to say, okay, how can I take a process that already exists and apply AI to making it better? That might be something like customer support or taking fraud down from 15 days to kind of cure to 10 days. And like going through that entire loop of mapping out the process, applying AI to it, seeing some sort of impact and then feeling the P and L or the kind of intrinsic benefits that, that, that looks like. The third thing then is like okay, great, now that you've seen impact, everybody is using it, how do you actually use it to inflect growth? And that can be something like improving the customer experience so your LTV or retention improves. It could be co creating a new kind of set of concepts or categories. It could be, you know, going from agents that are embedded to agents that are embodied and then being able to take on, you know, exponential number of tasks. I think that where companies fail is that they're doing AI for AI sake. They have a ton of projects that they're kicking off at the same time without a blueprint to understand how it actually works and what their stack looks like. And they aren't treating it like a real investment and so they don't have the measurement and the observability and the evals all kind of set up. It's going to do that end to end. I think the tricky thing is for enterprises is the technology is changing. There's something like 70,000 enterprise tools like in the AI space launched last year. It's really hard to know which one you should use for what outcome. And so you really need to bet on a platform or some sort of app server type layer that allows you to swap things in and out and not really be beholden to anything, any, any one technology or any one tool. Because the reality is is the whole thing is going to change. Feel like you have to actually build for the slope instead of the snapshot of where you are. So that's, that's kind of what I see at the enterprise level. I think the builders themselves are actually changing pretty fundamentally too. Right. Every single advent, like change in technology has invented a changing set of roles like mainframes to PCs, the whole garage, engineers. And then when we went from server to cloud and mobile, there was SEO specialists and CDNs and growth VMs and UXR and know, front end, back end and yada yada. And now I think we're seeing this advent of, of the polymath and where I think that full stack builders are kind of having their renaissance where if you take like an average organization, it takes probably 10 steps to launch a product. It could be security review, it could be spec, it could be, you know, user research. And there's what, five plus functions, maybe, maybe six or seven. I'm being generous for, for a normal organization. And then you have like six or seven layers. So all of a sudden you have 500 different touch points that have to happen to get a product out. And when there are 500 models available a week or 500 new technologies, that is just insufficient. And so I really believe in the concept of a full stack builder. You're seeing it with a bunch of the AI native companies that are coming up. I'm even seeing it in enterprises that have been around for 50 years starting to operate in that way. And I think that gives you velocity and throughput and then gives you the whole lo to start to actually metabolize and go through that much faster.",

We've got an AI product called Dragon that's for physicians. And we saw a massive difference from when we used synthetic fine tuning to when we annotated 600,000 patient physician interactions by experts and actually fed that into the model and continuously optimized it to then produce. I think we were sitting between 30 and 60 character acceptance rate depending on the run to something like 83%.

And I think that product makers really need to rewire their mindset around this, because I think we spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about the, the UI of something, rather than how something composes, how an agent's going to be able to read something, how do you actually get infinite scale?

And I think there's going to be a ton of those, far more than the software that we use today. And then I think There could be a set of embodied agents that are developed. And we start to see that now, right? You can assign a pull request to co pilot. You can create a software development rep that's agentic, that can kind of do some of the lead generation and mining for you. And so I think that when all of that happens, the work chart, the org chart starts to become the work chart. I think that tasks and throughput become more important than they have been before. I also think that you just don't need as many layers. I think the whole kind of organizational construct might start to look different in a few years. And so I'm pretty excited about it. I think meetings will still be meetings and they'll be weird, but I think they will be a bit better and I think there'll be lots of changes. I think that for the average employee, my hope and kind of my optimistic view is that they will be able to expand their skill set because now they have their own agent stack that they can bring with them to work. Just like you can kind of bring your own device and you can start to have access to a set of skills that you never had before. And so if you think about, know the 20 million people that maybe sit in that, that space across America and they get 20% more skilled, that's like pretty exponential for GDP.

      "en": "I mean, I'll caveat this by saying, like, everyone's just figuring it out. And it's a lot harder to figure it out when you're a larger organization than when you, you know, much smaller and you get to kind of, you know, run something yourself. And there's pros and cons to both. So here's what we do. We the company historically at least in our product teams had kind of semesters that they planned again. So think that as every six months there's kind of a strategy look back before and all of those things. I think that's very valuable. I think like the idea of six months though and really understanding what's changing out in front is truly challenging to kind of have a over baked situation. And so we kind of think about it as, you know, what season are we in. And so a season which is very uncomfortable can be denoted by a set of secular changes that are happening in the industry or that are happening from customers. And so you can think about season one might have been like the prototyping of AI and kind of the early GPT work and then it was all around models and reasoning models and now it's the advent of agents. And so that can last a year, that can last six months, that can last three months. But like grounding everybody on the ethos of what are the secular changes, what are the customer problems we need to solve, what does winning look like? So everybody has that shared sense. What is the North Star metric is something that we do. The second thing that we do is that we have kind of loose quarterly okr. So like, okay, if we believe that what do we need to do next quarter to actually put ourselves on a path to that? And then from there, you know, teams are operating in squads and they're kind of setting out four to six week goals that they're trying to go after for problem areas to go ladder up to that. And especially as the platform for the company and the platform for our Azure customers with AI, I will say we go through lots of changes to that all the time and I think we have to just have an openness that that is the business that we're in. I think the other thing is just like we try to leave slack in the system not just for the unplanned but for the slope. I think that we have to continuously be thinking about how we're going to disrupt the platform in our thinking and what we need to be investing in to make that possible.

      "en": "When I first took the role, it was kind of described as like the belly of the beast. And I had spent most of my career building products at the center of machine learning and applications or businesses. And I think that to my surprise, a lot of the learnings have translated in terms of what makes a great platform, is what makes a great product. And the thing for me is it's often in the invisible work or the not the pixels that actually drives that. So like for example, one of the first companies that I worked at was a company called Porch Group. I was employee seven and we knew we wanted to help people take care of their home. And I think we invented so many features like the home report or like a way to manage your home or like house style inspiration where you could like see all of the, the houses and it's map, map every single room. And the single most important thing that we could have done and did during my time there was create a matching platform that matched the 6 million professionals with the 1300 service types of the 37,000 zip codes and all of the homeowners in North America to actually take care of their, their home. And that was just the game of inches and kind of optimizing that engine in order to create higher quality leads. Essentially that's what got us to the first $500,500,000,000 valuation. That's eventually what we built on to actually have other vertical services and software platforms that IPO the company. Same with messaging. The number one learning that I had was look like WhatsApp didn't win because it had stickers or stories or dark mode. In fact, I don't even think it had all of those things when it won't. It won on a few premises because one was the phone book. Like you knew that when you use WhatsApp you could reach every single person because you had their phone number. And those are the people that you care about when you're using messaging. It was the reliability and how fast it was. Like I could text my grandmother in India and know that she would get my text message all the time. And then it was the privacy. Like when you are sending 200 messages a day to the four people you care about most, you want to make sure no one else can read the messages. And so the end to end encryption really mattered. And so it wasn't the hundreds of features. It was all in kind of the infrastructure and the platform. And same with Instacart. Right. Like, there are so many loved features of Instacart, but at the end of the day, it's a billion Items that updates 3,000 times every single minute to get homeowners their groceries from the store that they love. And so I think, I wish I had known that because I think it would have curtailed my learning curve to say that it's not all the features for the platform that matters. It's the data residency, so the hospital in Germany, that's fine tuning a model can do so in confidence. And the data isn't going to leave the region. It's the availability, it's the reliability. It's making sure you have the right selection of the tools that enterprises need and the right way to retrieve the knowledge. And that's kind of the platform that we've built, but just didn't fully have that picture that those learnings would translate.",

Like, you know, my mom has cancer, and I think a lot about how, wow, we might find a way to solve the form of cancer she has in my lifetime. And I never thought that was possible three years ago. Like, all of that's so deeply profound. And the thing that, like, I personally think a lot about, now that we know that we're living in this time, working with such powerful techniques, technology is the, the effects of it and how I can, you know, best build a platform where people can make use of it. So, like, the reason why I work at Microsoft is because, like, the whole ethos of the company is like, how do I help people and businesses achieve more and, like, more for me. And the thing, like, I think about at night, outside of, you know, GPUs, is, you know, I, I think about, like, will my son have classmates in the future? And that's not because agents are going to replace them. It's because the, the fertility rates are declining. Right. Like the, the average birth rate in the 90s when we were growing up was like 3, and now it's 2.3. And in 2050 it's estimated to be, you know, below replacement. And I think that AI can have such a big effect on it and already is like, I was just reading about a hospital in London that's, you know, able to improve pregnancy rates by using AI to match, you know, eggs and sperms and they're cutting costs at the same time. You saw with the ChatGPT 5 launch yesterday, such an amazing story about how ChatGPT is helping in healthcare. You know, Stanford's one of our big customers with the platform that I build and they're working on using AI for tumor reviews. And it's just like, that is, like, it is these sets of things that will like, move humanity forward and expand our lifetime and give us the like privilege to solve 100 year problems.

And so it's just a big capex investment to do that. And with this explosion of models that we talked about in the beginning, there's a lot of good models to choose from for different domains. And so I think that you just get more leverage economically. You get more leverage from a taste perspective of how you actually want to steer a model. If you're actually doing reinforcement learning or some sort of fine tuning to actually start to optimize what's off the shelf for some outcome like price, performance, quality. If you think about that, that's, that's not crazy, right? Like, you know, ranking is an age old optimization problem where you don't want to just take what's off the shelf because there's like amazing frameworks and UI and kind of components that you know the world is react components that are out there.
